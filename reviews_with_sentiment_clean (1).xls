EASWAR52	01-06-2023	Charminar	3	Historical CHARMINAR is the centre of attraction in Hyderabad. It is located in the midst of buzzing bazars. It is a simple structure containing four minarets. There are there are stairs with narrow & steep steps. In the upper floor one can see archways leading to balconies overlooking all four sides. These balconies provide beautiful views. Local culture is visible from the structure. The structure loses its worth due to the poor maintenance. In view of the steepness of the steps older people & those with knee issues will have difficulty in climbing the stairs. Though it is treated as a mosque it doesn‚Äôt look like one. Congested location makes the visit all the more difficult. One can visit here only to cherish the history and the view from here.  	Hyderabad	0.5118	Neutral	0	0	0	0.020833333	0
Mr. Himanshu Sinha	01-01-2023	Charminar	5	"Charminar is now getting too much filled with people, it's always very busy, and no proper management team is there. people are fighting over and over to reach a certain place, The stairs are very very steep if you want to climb to the top, the view is like, you are watching people everywhere. wherever your eyes turn you will see the crowd. Many staircases are closed due to maintenance, many rooms are closed, yes it's a famous spot in Hyderabad other than that I will not say it is a must-visit."

The place needs to be be maintained by the authorities for cleanliness as the locals, hawkers, shops and the tourists litter the place with disposals. People over there should be advised and fines to be imposed on breaking the rules. It is a pity that such a beautiful historic place is not maintained. One should not forget to have the falooda and lassi nearby. Shopping for glass bangles is a must for the ladies. "	Hyderabad	0.7226	Neutral	0	0	0.241666667	0.241666667	0

Najeeb Ahmad	01-02-2023	Charminar	5	"Charminar is an iconic monument located in the heart of Hyderabad, India. It is a famous tourist attraction that draws visitors from all over the world. The monument was built in 1591 and has since become a symbol of the city's rich history and culture.  The structure is a beautiful example of Islamic architecture, with four minarets that rise to a height of 56 meters. The monument is surrounded by a bustling market known as Laad Bazaar, where visitors can shop for traditional clothing, jewelry, and handicrafts.  Charminar is well-maintained and provides a range of facilities to visitors, including audio guides, restrooms, and drinking water facilities. The monument's interior is not open to visitors, but the stunning exterior is a sight to behold. The area around Charminar is vibrant and lively, with street food stalls selling delicious local delicacies. Visitors can also explore the nearby historical landmarks such as the Mecca Masjid and the Chowmahalla Palace.  The monument is open to visitors from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm every day, and there is a small entrance fee for non-Indian visitors.  Overall, Charminar is a must-visit tourist destination that showcases the rich cultural heritage of Hyderabad. The monument's stunning architecture and the bustling market around it make for a memorable experience for visitors. ----------------------- ‚úçÔ∏èüì∏mr_najeeb_07 "	Hyderabad	0.9861	Positive	0.262651515	0	0	0.262651515	0

I had a tour guide so that I could understand about the building and local points of interest.  What disappointed me (although I have now seen this frequently on my travels) is that there is one fee for residents and I think is was a 25 times increase of the price for foreigners. As said this now seems the norm. I understand the reason but I had never seen this before in any country that I had been too so was suprised. That being said, it is a major landmark and I would recommend a visit and if possible get a tour guide. It does get busy there. "	Hyderabad	0.7743	Neutral	0	0	0	0	0

Avoid going there on Weekends or festival times. Be careful with your mobile and money. No proper maintenance and respect for tourists in this area.  The view is good from inside and outside Charminar. The only issue is no maintenance and officials seem to get used to it, so they don't care about beggars and robbers who are troubling travelers.  Use only Ola or Uber if you are traveling alone or with family. Autowala charges double the cost here.  Old age people, avoid climbing Charminar. The steps are very deep and the width is very small. They will inform you only at the entry, so you may lose money if you decide not to climb after purchasing tickets. "	Hyderabad	-0.866	Neutral	0	0	0	0.044230769	0

Saurabh M	01-12-2022	Charminar	4	" Exploring Telangana....... Hyderabad......at Chairminar........Best way to reach is get down at MGBS metro station and take bus or auto..... Or directly auto from anywhere....  An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.  Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  The structure of Charminar is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences. The arches and domes of the monument define the influence of Islamic architecture, while the Persian influence is prominent from its minarets. The balconies and the outside walls, embellished with delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, showcases the influence of the Hindu style of architecture.At the base of the Charminar is a small temple called as ""Bhagyalakshmi Temple""....  The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city.  According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies.  Charminar is famous for many things but is most known for the lip smacking dishes and great bargain shopping. There is no better place for shopping in Hyderabad than the area surrounding the Charminar. The streets are brimming with people at all times, with the shops displaying attractive and colourful bangles and jewellery. It is popular for bangles, pearls, jewellery, semi-precious stones, silverware, Kalamkari paintings, sarees, silk materials, gold embroidered fabric, lacquer bangles, ittar and the traditional Khara dupatta. This street is filled with people and haggling is part and parcel of this market..... "	Hyderabad	0.9786	Neutral	0.231393298	0	0	0.231393298	0

You have to get to the top, take a breather, and go down through a similar staircase. We went there and my mom almost fainted. If you're claustrophobic, DO NOT take a chance here.

The area surrounding it is a busy street and jewelry market. You can find inexpensive bangles (bracelets) as well as very low priced 'pearls' which would make a cute item for young girls. There are also a number of Pearl Shops supposedly selling the gem that the city is famed for.

Basically, it was easy to get in and out. I've been here three times before and as always, the Charminar was under repairs, this time around too. There was a scaffold around three sides of the monument. So a good selfie wasn't possible. However, it felt good to walk around it and have an Irani tea and a wedge of Dilkhush (bread stuffed with dried fruits) as an early breakfast from one of the many tea shops in the area.

Saurabh M	01-12-2022	Golconda Fort	4	"Exploring Telangana........Hyderabad..... At the famous Golkonda fort......How to reach can take a auto or ola directly there....... Golconda Fort Hyderabad is an outstanding example of brilliant engineering and magical architecture. Located at a distance of 11km from the city, it is the most famous of all Hyderabad tourist places. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words ""Golla"" and ""Konda"" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'.An impressive structure, which once, would have bewitched every onlooker, stands majestically even today. Golconda Fort is sure to impress you with not only with that highly advanced techniques were used back then and sturdy structure, but also with an outstanding view of the surrounding city.Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this massive Golconda Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings.The name Golconda Fort has a legend behind it. As per the story, a shepherd boy was once walking on this hill when he had come across a God idol. The news about the shepherd boy and his findings reached the then ruler of Kakatiya Dynasty. The King then decided to built a fort on the hill, which then came to be known as Golconda (Shepherd‚Äôs Hill) Fort.However, almost 200 years later, the fort came under Bahamani rulers. Later Qutub Shahi Kings took the fort under their control and extended it further. The fort was fortified and expanded during the reign of Bahamani rulers and Qutub Shahi Dynasty. Later in 1687, this fort came under the rule of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. It was then the fort was left unattended.At present, the Golconda Fort constitutes a complex layout of palaces, temple mosques and pavilion, all of which unfortunately are in ruins now.Architecture of Golconda FortWith perimeters of around 11 kilometers, the fort has 15 to 18 foot high walls. It has huge gates that have pointed iron spikes on them. This protected the fort from Elephants damaging the fort as well as enemy attacks. Golconda fort presents a mesmerizing architecture which will astonish you at each and every step. This fort has been built on a granite rock with a height of 12 meters. Huge rampart around the golconda fort was built, a glimpse of which can still be seen.The system of acoustics in the Fort is something which attracts each and every visitor. The sound of clapping at the entrance can be heard at the ‚ÄòBala Hissar' which is the highest point and almost a kilometre away. This system was apparently used for communication purposes, especially to alert royal in case of any attack.Other attractive features of the Fort include water supply system which does leave many marvelling at the advancement of the technical and scientific knowledge while constructing this fort. Another popular aspect is the 'Rahban' cannon.Ramdas‚Äô prison is one of the popular spots inside the fort. According to legend, Ramdas who was a revenue collector in Abdul Hasan Shah's court was imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he carved Hindu deities on the wall of his cell. One can see many carvings of Hindu Lord Hanuman on the wall, which are now smeared with holy vermillion. A holy lamp or two (diyas) is also kept lit in front of the carvings."

It is recommended to take the government approved guides( INR 750) to understand the true essence of the place. The guides are helpful with showing the stellar architectural nuances of whispering walls and echo points. It is worth climbing to the top of the fort. It is about 400 steps each way. The city view is excellent from there- panoramic in every sense of the word. There is a stall on the top with basic water and chocolates which provides adequate replenishments.

But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it.

The Route Edit	01-01-2020	Golconda Fort	4	"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "	Hyderabad	0.0483	Neutral	0	0	0	0.274404762	0

The Route Edit	01-01-2020	Golconda Fort	4	"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "	Hyderabad	0.0483	Neutral	0	0	0	0.274404762	0

The water supply system present here and defensive mechanisms provided are really wonderful.Here one can experience the perfect acoustics provided in the structures. The fort displays past history.

However, whilst walking around, I met a group of people from the USA (although their manager came from the UK but lives in the States now), and they said the tour guide was excellent.  So I cannot really comment on what experience they provide.  They sell books on the history.  Be prepared to walk and have comfortable shoes.   The climb to the top is worth it though as you see for miles.  It is an amazing structure. "	Hyderabad	0.9738	Neutral	0	0	0	0.4	0

The first half was checking around sets via an A/C bus with guide followed by a lunch.The lunch at Superstar hotel was really not as per Ramoji's standard. Poor state of veg food, pathetically slow roti service. Not worth the price. Taste was just OK. If the restaurant can not handle volume, then they should not even entertain that much of volume.The stalls outside offered much better food.The shows were great as well, the package that I opted was too lengthy for my enthusiasm, at around 5 PM, I wish there were no more shows. I wanted a good tea with some snacks, that experience was not that great as well. Food & restaurants surely needs to improve for the prices that are offered for.There was a winter fest that made the place even beautiful with lights, perhaps, I had left with no energy & zeal to enjoy that.It was a good experience, wish I had got some good food."

Raman G	01-11-2022	Ramoji Film City	4	"It is a full day tour. About 40 km from Hyderabad.  The largest film city complex in the world. The owners of film city also organize tours for guests for the huge complex. Tours from around 9 am to 530 pm. We took a Star experience tour. Booked online in advance from their website. ( they have a toll free number as well for any enquiries) . It is a guided tour of the grounds, sets and the special shows. The advantage is that this tour   is communicating in a AC bus. Which was definitely a comfort for us. It includes a buffet  lunch- which was ok. If you need, the organizers also arrange a bus pick up and drop from various  points in Hyderabad. But depending on your pick up location. It can be a 2 hour ride in the bus to the film city. We hired a taxi for full day. ( abt Rs 3000 for the day). We reached a bit before 10 am. It is recommended to reach by 9 am as they ask to, as the tour definitely ends at 530pm. We did notice that for return to Hyderabad in the evening  there are stalls at film city for return transport , but do not know the charge? ( in case you only take a drop to film city by own transport). You can visit the film city without booking any of the tour package as well. It will be a walk in for the tickets. We noticed that these are quite crowded as a group. If you have visited any such film city  tours abroad, say in Singapore or San Francisco, these are very much of a very high standard and quality in thrills and excitement and experience as compared to Ramoji.But in India, it is surely one a kind. Tour includes, rides, walk through bird parks, gardens, visit film sets,  walk through film sets and shows.

Ashish G	01-09-2022	Ramoji Film City	4	"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful experience and a must visit. I'll list down some delighters and things that can be improved based on my experience.  Pros first1. Lots of things to do and experiences to have. 2. The shows are very impressive. Spirit of Ramoji, Wild West were in particular very nice. 3. There were a good amount of rides for children and adults to enjoy. 4. The eco park was very good, especially the bonsai collection was amazing to see. 5. Haunted house was a good experience for kids. Things that can be improved1. The brochure was very confusing. There is no way you can cover all the things in Ramoji in a day, so the brochure should give more detailed information which helps the people to choose based on their interest. 2. We took the star experience package which was the more expensive one. However they kept passing us from one person to other person without anyone explaining what is the plan for the day. Even on asking they were not interested to answer and just kept pointing to someone else. It felt we missed out on lots of things simply because no-body told us. Also the bus was so overcrowded that everyone did not even got a seat and lots of time was wasted in sorting that out. The star experience didn't feel worth the money and I felt I would have been better off with a regular ticket and planning the day myself, rather than leaving it to the star experience providers. 3.  Don't think this falls under the jurisdiction of Ramoji, but the travel to and from Ramoji was a big headache. We booked a ticket via BestBus which seemed to show on their site that they are the official partners with Ramoji. However it was a bad experience, as they kept asking us to change pickup point without realizing how difficult it would be for someone to reach different pickup point at short notice. Even while drooping off they didn't drop us at our designated dropping point. I would strongly suggest giving BESTBUS a skip and find another option to reach there."

There is bus service inside, you can go from one point to another by bus (no additional cost). Bring your own water bottle as there is a drinking water tap at every point where you can refill your water bottle for free.

They need to learn from Chowki Dhani, Jaipur how unlimited food is served!! They go around the tables to serve people and people eating dont have to go again n again to get smthing! Worst is on reaching the buffet spot, you may not even find the dish you came for ü´§. Plus, Ramuji and family, when you source out to these caterers do you even chk what they are serving and how?

Reach at 9 am so u can watch opening ceremony. 2 lines for tickets, 1 for direct ticket from ticket counter and onther who have online tickets. Evening parade is good. In evening whole film city is decorated by lights so u feel u are in another world. Must experience this. Most of rides are complementary free. At sahas adventure location u will enjoy adventure rides free of cost. One full day required for visit. Kids zone is also good and photogenic.

Amol S	01-05-2022	Ramoji Film City	1	"We visited this place with lot of expectations but were left very disappointed with overall experience!Total ticket cost for family of 2 adults and 2 kids was 5400 for absolutely nothing worth mentioning to see Horror starts right from beginning when u are asked to park car 5 kms away from main premise. From there all tourists are put in outdated buses like prisoners and taken to main film city area .So once you are in you just can not leave place without going through entire torture. Guided tour lasts only about 30 mins and after that you are left there from point to point to explore nothing. Adventure sports area sports like paintball , archery are all useless. For paintball just one person standing there asking u to shoot 3 shots on target . Archery session arch set looks like it is third class china toy bought at 100 from local market. That also only one ser is there. In short what is included in ticket is all useless stuff but advertised by Mr Ramoji as if its out of the world Sahaj adventure sports .For kids only space yatra which lasted for 5 mins and bird park was only area worth mentioning.In addition like prisoners you are not allowed to carry any food inside . Firstly with exorbitant ticket cost now they like are further allowed to take more money from your pocket.Restaurant called Jimmy is total useless with third grade food at five star prices .Worst is you cant leave place as you are stuck there !!Pls avoid avoid and donate money to some needy !!!"

AjithBhaskaran	01-03-2022	Ramoji Film City	4	"Worth a visit if you are on a trip to Hyderabad - it is around 1 1/2 hours drive from City Centre. Gives an idea as to how films are made and sets are constructed. Need to either reach by around 9 am or better still stay there in one of the hotels inside RFC the previous evening as you need a full day to see everything. Even a full day is a bit rushed. Best to pick up tickets ('Studio Tour' is good enough) online, go to the centre point (Eureka), attend the opening ceremony at 9.45 am, proceed to Studio Tour/Eco Tour (must do), have lunch, then go for the shows. Don't miss the Wild West Stunt Show! Lights, Camera, Action is interesting too. Rest of the shows are average, especially for someone who has been to other studios/sets elsewhere. Pick up a brochure and plan your day ahead. Food within RFC is average or even below average."	Hyderabad	0.9375	Neutral	0.198958333	0	0	0	0

Had no idea they had such an amazing collection and the birds looked like they were vey well taken care of. The Moviemaking Part was amazing and the 'Director' was very funny.OUR GUIDE: Loved our guide Datta Ji. He was very patient and very courteous. He let us choose which spots we wished to disembark for and offered to take our pictures everywhere we went.

Raviraj Rodrigues	01-08-2021	Ramoji Film City	5	"The property is built on the lines of Disneyworld, but at a much lower scale and finish quality. However for the entry price, I would say its worth a one time visit. We got to see many sets. both live and ready for shooting. Some of them are permanent like Mughal gardens, Rajput Palaces, Wild West, Indian Village scenes etc. Some others were created for one movie and left for tourists to enjoy like the sets of Bahubali. They have some lovely gardens, bird park and butterfly park too. However, one can truly enjoy the place only by staying inside the filmcity in one of their hotels for atleast 2 nights. There is too much to see and do and the guided tour of 2.5 hours will not do justice to the place. We could spend early mornings and late evening on the sets and gardens as we stayed in the resort and were permitted to move around. "	Hyderabad	0.9794	Neutral	0	0	0	0.195454545	0

Few parks were open and in lush greenery so it was just a close-to-nature trip.My toddler could run around freely and enjoyed it a lot.I will surely visit again.

We ate Veg-Food and it was good, but price was Rs.300/- comparing to outside of film city it cost just or below 100/-. So Price was pretty much higher. Except food all are reasonable rates. Unfortunately i forgot my bag at clock room and left HYD and reached my home town. After contacted them they were very helpful and responded in a cooperative nature.

From there it is that super  sweet red bus to take you along.It is so interesting and intriguing and beautiful that you dont want it to end. Honestly you cannot see all in a day. Though I visited this place 2 years ago I m still in love with it. When this covid menace is over I would certainly go there again to regenerate myrself.  Its just lovely. I can bet that like me you too will be amazed. Go and visit if you are in hyderabad.  If you don't see ramoji you will regret it for sure. But a little piece of caution.

Next we boarded their red bus for a grand tour which took us to different locations like Bahubali movie set, Japanese Gardens, London street, Butterfly park, Bird park, Kripalu caves and many more.

Whole property is very well maintained. Plenty of photo options for photography lovers.While we come across each sets it reminds of some movie of any Indian language. Highlight is Bahubaali set for our group. Lot of walking involved inside but great experience.Definitely with high standards and competitive comparison with other similar concept around the world. It was not really fully crowded probably because of school examinations time and week day as well. Great memorable experience. Descent food options available inside at decent price range.

Rashmi_Warty	01-02-2020	Ramoji Film City	5	"Much better than what we had seen in a similar theme park in Australia. Perhaps the Indianisation helps. It seemed that the target population was (also) people who could not go outside India and the objective was to offer them a well crafted and entertaining content at a reasonable price, without burning a hole in their pockets.  Of course it does have high end packages for those who require a vip service. So it is a buffet of different packages. We had decided to spend time till lunch and then return back to pavilion. But we spent the whole day leaving the place only at 6 o‚Äôclock in the evening. In fact it is a place fit for spending at least two days. There is a lot to see especially for kids and the younger lot. It is a theme park as well as a working film studio. We were told that it was spread over two thousand acres.Action Theater - by far the best piece of the entire place in my opinion. They have cleverly woven audience participation in the show. Volunteers were selected at random from the audience and were asked to ride stationary two-wheelers to enact a scene of robbers chasing on the road. Then they showed the ‚Äòreel life‚Äô transformation of that which really looked like a live chase on a road. They also demonstrated how sound is added to a movie with mundane equipment. Highly entertaining. And gave us terrific insights into movie making.Bird Park was another place that we loved. The park has one of the best collection of birds. The birds looked in really good shape - unlike the usual bored ones in a zoo. The Star Wars 4D experience was also thrilling albeit short. Other star attractions are movie sets of Bhagavatham and Bahubali. The place also boasts a nice bonsai garden. There are several other things which one can visit depending upon one‚Äôs liking, age group, and energy level. If you think you require a leisurely pace, better spread the experience over two days. There are free hop on hop off buses all around. But still it is a not a place for a quick visit of a few hours. Or one can pay higher and go for the guided tour of one (full) day."

Maresa G	01-01-2020	Ramoji Film City	4	"This is a worthwhile 1.5 hr roadtrip from the city Centre if you're 1. A big Bollywood fan or 2. You're a child.I am a Bollywood fan but not a fanatic, and found this tour to be worthwhile and quite a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Hyderbadh.I enjoyed the fact that there is a lot more to do than merely tour a film studio.  Mr Ramoji Rao clearly is an entrepreneur who knows how to bring in the crowds, and this can be a most enjoyable trip for a family with young kids, with the very attractive amusement park, Eureka and Fundustan;  the Ramoji Movie Magic section with its Filmmaking experience, Eyelusion Gallery, Black Light show, Stunt show; as well as a bird park and butterfly garden, and a Japanese and bonsai garden, being just a few of the numerous immaculate gardens dotted around the grounds.We visited now during the last week of the ""Longest Winter Fest"", which ran from 13 Dec and which will end on 26 Jan;  hence the visiting crowds reasonably large, but clearly thinning out at this time, hence thankfully not having to queue for tickets.The bus tours offered between 10am - 5pm are very well organized, allowing one to cover the grounds of the entire film city in pretty much 4 - 5 hours. I thought this was more than enough time, but was rather disappointed that the tour guides only spoke in Hindi, and there was no attempt at all to accommodate us foreigners. Should you want to experience this park fully, one can book a night at one of Ramoji's hotels and then have more than enough time to experience the various carnival shows and dance performances which take place after the park has closed.No doubt, there is a lot to see, do and experience at Ramoji's Wonderland for anyone;  whether you're a Bollywood fan, a local tourist, a child, or merely just a foreigner wanting to see how Ramoji the Magician transformed 1666 Ha of land into the World's Largest Film City!

Saurabh M	01-12-2022	Nehru Zoological Park	5	"Exploring Telangana...... Hyderabad.....at Zoo....Located at a distance of 16 km from Hyderabad, Nehru Zoological Park was opened to the public in the year of 1963. It is situated near the historically important Mir Alam Tank, which is 200 year old and is the first multi-arch masonry dam in the world. Nehru Zoological Park is one of the largest zoos of India . Run by the Forest department, Government of Telangana, the zoo has been named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country........What makes Hyderabad zoo an amiable place for both visitors and inhabitants are the open enclosures in which animals are kept. These open enclosures have been created to resemble the natural habitats. A wide variety of exotic animals have been successfully bred in this zoo park as well.There is electric car which is very helpful......"	Hyderabad	0.8908	Neutral	0	0	0	0.196153846	0

Outside the main gate it is a bit too chaotic and noisy and dusty with broken roads but that's Hyderabad. The zoo could have done with more logical signposts to different enclosures so that we don't miss a single creature. The safari rides last 15 minutes but give you a good look at lions, tigers, bisons. Lots of schoolkids on their school-organised visits lend to the nice feel of the place.

It's best to go early (at 8:30-9am) when the animals are up and about as they tend to retire for the afternoon.Specially enjoyed the nocturnal animal den and snake pits. TPro tip: if you want to enjoy the Safari, take the hop-on/hop-off tickets and get down at the Safari stop (3rd stop after the elephant stop), as it is a LONG walk and difficult to get back to, especially with children.

Got disappointed a bit.They have a cheetah exhibit, a large deer and emu exhibit, and a large elephant exhibit. Other animals worth note are lion, tiger, white tiger, wolf, fox, jackal, gaur, hippo, rhino, ostrich, two types of bear, giraffe, sambar, blackbuck, white deer and crocodiles. There are some walk in aviaries, but entry now restricted due to Covid situation. Did not see any large apes, but seen a few small monkeys. All animals are kept in natural settings, though sometimes a little small.There are battery cars which are hop-on hop-off types, excellent to traverse the zoo, though still it takes much walking. The toy train starts only after a minimum number of passengers. It is possible to walk the entire length, there is a major circular path and small inner walkways.There is a refundable Rs. 10 per bottle  deposit to take plastic bottles inside."

There are not a massive amount of animals but the ones that are there looked to be in a reasonable condition and had food and water, though the cages for the birds didn't have any greenery in them which was sad. For those who don't like walking too much, there are various transport options like a train and some small golf cart trailers who'll take you around  for a small charge. Also, halfway round the zoo there's a bus that you can board, for an extra 50 Rs, to take you on a mini 'safari' where you can see lions, a tiger and some bears. I was saddened to see them in cages though....the area of the safari would be big enough for them to roam free, but they've been contained in featureless enclosures which is sad. Outside of this, there's a lot of imagination shown, with tunnels and fossil parks and all sorts. It does make for a good day out, but there could be some improvement with more seating and some restaurants and water points. Overall, pretty good, though a bit more foliage in the bird cages would be kinder for them, plus more staff presence to stop people whistling and harassing the animals is definitely needed."

Overall it's a great place and takes 4-5 hours to cover on weekends, located close to city. The park is well maintained with toy train, battery operated hop on cars, and ample animals to see especially if you have kids with you or if you are first timer. However inadequate signages make you  walk a lot, stand in slow and unorganized ques etc. The safari is a total time waste considering tigers are caged.

Now coming to the bad parts of the visit - We went on Sunday which is the most busy day for the park.So as expected it was very crowded. We wanted to rent a personal cart but after standing in the line for 1 hour I was told they dont have any available I have to do the sharing cart. But they gave a personal cart to the guy who did not even stand in the line as he had a connection with some hid ranked departments. The guys driving the carts had such an arrogant attitude that most of the people riding it could feel it and had lot of altercations with them.Other than that we had a great visit and could show so many animals to my son.

They have kept different types of birds, peacocks etc. in reptiles we have seen some crocodiles and different types of snakes.It is nicely maintained and it is very clean. Before the entrance there is the proper checking where staff don‚Äôt allow anyone to carry plastic bags inside the zoo. After the entrance you will find a mini van service which is quite good if you have old age people with you or if your kids are very small who cannot walk long distance. Zoo is spread in the vast area where you need to walk a long distance to cover all the animals.After the entrance there is toy train also. Ticket is very reasonable. Rs 20 for adult and Rs.10 for child. I advise you to take this toy train, kids will enjoy a lot. It covers the complete zoo area in 25 mins.There is Safari service also but we skipped it because of lot of rush. So better go early so that you don‚Äôt miss this safari service.You will not find much eateries inside. You will find ample drinking water and public toilets inside the zoo at various places.You will require full day to enjoy complete zoo but we spent 4 hours and skipped some of the places.We had a wonderful time in this zoo."

They used to allow our own vehicles inside, Now you have to park and remember to reach early if you are going on a public holiday or weekend.2. No plastic allowed inside. Any plates, covers, bags are strictly prohibited. 3. Best time to reach there is 9:00 AM. 4. Don't expect much in safari. There is nothing to it and I recommend you skip it unless you hear of any improvements/changes.5. Vast area so be prepared to walk even though you have rented battery car, they operate from point to point but you still need to walk around quite a bit.Overall, I feel neatness has improved with plastic and vehicle ban, having said that what this zoo needs is more animals :-) Hope they can bring in more attractions as it has potential to go long way."

You have to wait in the queue for at least an hour on weekends. Can have refreshment corners at more number of places. Other things are fine.	Hyderabad	-0.5288	Neutral	0	0	0	-0.01875	0

Ashwin J	01-11-2018	Nehru Zoological Park	3	"Have been wanting to visit this place since the time i came to Hyderabad.... The place is easy to locate following Google maps...Reached around 12pm and it was extremely crowded... Parking was a big hassle and finally they asked to park in a spot...Went inside and saw a long queue for the shuttle... Decided to go for the toy train... Apparently the toy trains were booked until 4'30 by some school... So they were asking us to wait for 4hrs to board a toy train... Hopeless management of logistics...The shuttle was managed equally bad... People just jump the queue and get into the bus... No consideration given to parents with little kids or elderly people... Management needs to come up with a smarter way to handle the crowd... I have been to zoos inside and outside India... Never faced this problem.... Coming to animals and birds... No animals were active... Most of them were hiding inside their shelter... Many shelters had only 1 animal. I have always seen at least 2 animals in one shelter... But here, there was only 1 tiger, 1 jaguar, 1 giraffe etc... No companionship for the animals... Nothing was great that made the experience a wow experience... Normal zoo just hyped because of low entry fee... The safari again had waiting time of 3hrs.... The lack of planning by authorities was evident everywhere.... Two layers of cars and bikes were parked behind our car... Struggled for minimum 1hr to take the car.... Will not suggest this place... You can take the risk of visiting this place but don't drive and be ready to wait and wait and wait"	Hyderabad	-0.9091	Neutral	0	0	0	0.047282609	0
Reon Sylvester	01-11-2018	Nehru Zoological Park	5	"It is a huge zoo spread over hundreds of acres. It has variety of colourful birds, Reptiles and other animals. White tiger is the most attractive one. And also few bears.One can rent a bicycle(individual) or electric vehicle( for a group of people) to cover the entire zoo by paying prescribed Fee. There are many shops as well. Overall, this zoo is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"	Hyderabad	0.8858	Neutral	0	0	0	0	0

There is nothing extraordinary here common animals which you see in any other zoo in India is what they have here.

White tiger, lions,  leopards, elephants, crocs, snakes, chameleons, owls, giraffe etc.Please do make notice of following point which will help you if you visit over there:1. Entry tickets are just to make entry in zoo.2. If you want to travel on battery car at important point where you can see animals then it ticket you will get inside. (WOULD STRONGLY recommend this as there are lots of waling) or you can opt for bicycle on rent for each individual.3. If you want to take safari which is separate from zoo then, you have buy tickets inside, they will take inside the restricted zone where lions are roaming free (we saw just one).4. If you want to see OWLS, then you have shell 20 INR per head inside zoo. This place is right after reptile section.Overall an amazing place."	Hyderabad	0.9353	Neutral	0	0	0	0.285449735	0
Vidyadheesh U	01-01-2018	Nehru Zoological Park	5	"Nehru Zoological Park is spread over 380 acres of land. It houses about 155 species of animals, birds and reptiles. It was opened to general public in the year 1963. It is one of the largest zoos in India and a major tourist attraction in Hyderabad.They sheer size of the park makes it a half day or a full day activity. There are battery operated vehicles inside the park for conveyance but most of the park has to be still covered on foot. It is better to be equipped with caps, hats or scarves to protect yourself from the harsh sun. It is a plastic free zone hence you need to make arrangement to carry water for children accompanying you, if any. What makes this Zoo more endearing is that the animals have kept in an open enclosure, however due care has been taken vis-√†-vis the safety aspect for animals as well as visitors. The open enclosure is close to their natural habitat though not entirely replicated. The animals are stationed under the following zones:  Primate Park ‚Äì Monkeys, Baboon, Chimpanzee etcCarnivore Plaza ‚Äì Tiger, Hyena, Wild Dogs, Jackal, Fox, JaguarLion Junction ‚Äì Lions, Leopard, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus Bears Bay ‚Äì Indian Sloth Bear, Malayan Sun Bear, various birdsDeer Land ‚Äì Gaur, Antelope, Black Buck & NilgaiReptile Row ‚Äì Various types of reptiles like snakes, tortoise, iguana, crocodile.Parrot World ‚Äì Parrots, Parakeet, Macaw, Nocturnal Animal World ‚Äì Owls, Porcupine, LorisElephant Odyssey ‚Äì Elephant, PeafowlThe place is kept clean and hygienic. It must be taking a lot of effort on the part of the staff to maintain the levels of cleanliness.Entry fee is very nominal and they charge you separately for photography, videography etc.My daughter got her live introduction to wild animals here and now she just adores them."

The ground floor had many experiments, which show the workings of scientific principles in a practical sense. The 1st floor had models of the part of Antarctica which is controlled by India and had the model of the sunken city of Dwarka (very informative). The 2nd level had the bones and information on Dinosaurs and other animals that lived with the dinosaurs. The museum has a lot to show and see so it could be completed in about 3 hours.

Well explanation and 360¬∞ screen are like you are sitting under clear sky. Though , I felt explanation can be made little easier fir understanding of school children.2. 3D movie about solar and space facts:Great for young school children knowing already and having watched many 3 movies it felt boating. 3. Art Galary : perhaps biggest one I hva visited so far. Spread on 3 floors, most people just visit modern art Galary and miss the best part. In front of art Galary there is huge series of art, Specially we liked painting by Iqbal Hussain on Indian Mythology and history . Amazing details. I wish I could take photos but it wasn't allowed.4.Dianasorium: Huge skeleton of Dianasour found near Hyderabad and information are gear. Touching 200 million old fossil is just a great experience.5.Science Museum with live experiments: this is just a unique experience of day to day life physics. Huge learning for any student. There is IEEE experiments to hands on too. This must for any student to visit.Overall, in 200 per head, this is most fun place in Hyderabad so far."

CaptainBasu	01-03-2017	Birla Science Museum	3	"The place is a storehouse of some greatly intriguing science objects. However, it is very poorly maintained. The planetarium is small but the explanations were clear. Remember to bring lots of water on a summer day. Though not too big, you will need to walk up and down a number of stairs.Suggest climb right up to the planetarium first (shows in English starts at 1130) walking your way down thru the galleries on different levels to reach the science museum at the ground level. There is a separate ticket for the Planetarium which includes the 3D show, and separate ones for the rest of the place. The entry prices kept changing based on God knows what. It was RS.60 on Monday when we arrived, but came up to RS.80 by Wednesday when we actually visited.The science section needs serious maintenance, many gizmos are either inoperative or totally absent.  The Planetarium offers some interesting shows along with the 3D theatre of the seven wonders of Solar system. Expect to spend three hours at leisure."	Hyderabad	0.8674	Neutral	0	0	0	0.036545285	0

Otherwise, its a perfect place to spend the day with children. They will spend the day discovering, learning, experimenting and watching. At the end of 3 hours, we were still not done. The Nirmala Birla Dolls Museum , then the Archeology museum, where we really saw the grandeur of our past - stone age, iron age, pottery meticulously preserved, terracotta animal figurines that reminded me of Harappa valley pottery figurines.  Then there was Indian painting, Philately, Numismatics, Art. It was 2 hours before the children exited just the basement floor. Then we went to the science experience center, where children play with specially created learning toys. You can easily put kids there for 90 minutes and forget about them. After that it was time for the observatory in the planetarium next door, so off we went. We could see Mars (nothing impressive) and Jupiter(we saw the stripes of Jupiter and the 4 moons of Jupiter). It was awesome! Then we came back to the Dinosaurium. It has a full skeleton of a large dinosaur, one preserved egg fossil, and some bone fossils. Its an awe inspiring skeleton. The building is basic, but that skeleton.. is something!! We missed the space and Antartica Diorama, but we have seen that earlier.

Hussain sagar lake is a lake that has a buddha statue which is apparently carved out of a single stone. The statue is beautiful and for seeing the statue you need to take a boat ride either from ""Eat Street"" or from ""Lumbini Park"" there are also private small ships namely bhagmati etc which can be used for a private party, kitty party etc which has a restaurant inside it. These boats also have a live dance performance. The regular boat ticket is priced at 50INR which is adequate. The statue is worth spending it.  The boat ride is amazing and it drops you at buddha statue and gives you 15 minutes to enjoy the beauty of the statue and click pictures. After 15 minutes it takes you back to either ""Eat street"" or ""Lumbini park"" where ever you took the boat from. The experience is worth it for 50 bucks."	Hyderabad	0.9744	Neutral	0	0	0	0	0

Bus No: 5K,5S,5 From Secunderabad to Mehdipatnam any bus no. 113 from Uppal to Mehdipatnam.Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took 10 years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir....The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation.Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Deva and Devi including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi. Selected because teachings of men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders."

All vehicles ( specially cars) cannot turnabout until the temple gate and hence you will always have a backed up traffic to challenge. once you get into the temple , you have to deposit your mobile/ electronics and footwear into its respective lockers/ spaces. The mobile locker line will delay you further if you don‚Äôt go early morning. After this, the pristine beauty of the granite hill top temple will captivate you no bounds.

Each price is for 15 min lake tour.The 2nd entrance is from the park side whose openning time is 5.00am - 8.30am and 4pm - 8pm - Here one have to pay entrance fee of INR 10/- per adult and INR 5/- per child. Parking space available and is free.Lots of contruction and higtises and raods surround the lake which is eye-sore but there are vegetationa nd natural formations at places which are very good to see. We saw few migratory bird species in the lake during our visit.Also a good initiative is to avoid litters, the place do not have any eateries.

You will come across broken benches and litter every where. If the stench does not make you ill then the cool drinks or snacks will surely make you ill. Out side food is not allowed and you are forced to buy stale food.
